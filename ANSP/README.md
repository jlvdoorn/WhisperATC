- Fine-Tuning
- Fine-Tuned Performance

## Data Creation

The ```CreateANSPDataset.ipynb``` notebook is used to built the ANSP dataset.

## Baseline Performance

The ```Evaluate_Baseline.ipynb``` notebook is used to assess the baseline performance of the models on the ANSP dataset.

## Fine-Tuning

The ```Fine-Tuning.py``` file is used to fine-tune the models on the created ANSP dataset.

## Fine-Tuned Performance

The ```Evaluate_Fine-Tuned.ipynb``` notebook is used to assess the fine-tuned performance of the models on the ANSP dataset.
