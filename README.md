# WhisperATC

Applying Large-Scale Weakly-Supervised Automatic Speech Recognition to Air Traffic Control

## Data Preparation

The ```CreateDataset``` module contains the necessary files to create and upload datasets to huggingface. A random split is made in the data where 80% will be used for training and 20% for validaiton. Currently the following datasets are available:

- [ATCO2-ASR](https://www.doi.org/10.57967/hf/1377)
- [ATCOSIM](https://www.doi.org/10.57967/hf/1378)
- [ATCO2-ASR-ATCOSIM](https://www.doi.org/10.57967/hf/1379)

However, the latter will only be used for training purposed and not for evaulation as it does not form a benchmark.

## Prompt Testing

The ```PromptTesting``` module contains the files used for the iterative experiments on prompting and normalization.

## Evaluation

Two scripts are available for evaluating the models. One is for evaluating the blank models and the second is for evaulating the fine-tuned models. The fine-tuned model weights will be converted into the whisper format in order to be used for inference. This folder also contains the normalization script.

## Fine-Tuning

The fine-tuning scripts are created to form a modular way of fine-tuning the blank Whisper models on the created datasets. The models will automatically be uploaded into the huggingface format. The fine-tuning relies on the ```deepspeed``` package. Currently the following fine-tuned models are available:
